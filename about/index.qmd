title: "Who am I"
---

  I am **Amir Salimi Babamiri**, a PhD candidate at **Cardiff Business School** (Data Lab for Social Good). I am interested in sustainable supply chain management, striving to make both academic and practical contributions to the development of sustainable supply chains. 

I am honored to be a recipient of the ESRC Wales Doctoral Training Partnership Studentship from UK Research and Innovation. The studentship is collaborative with Unseen UK. 

My goal is to leverage cutting-edge research to foster sustainable and ethical supply chains.
## Education

* **PhD**, Cardiff Business School — Machine Learning & Forecasting for Socially Sustainable Supply Chain Management
* **[Previous degree(s) — add details if you want]**
  
## Research focus / PhD project
  
  My research focuses on understanding and modelling the impact of consumer purchasing behaviour on global supply chain decisions related to anti-slavery practices. My PhD research is aimed at:

1- Understanding and assessing consumer behaviour and attitudes towards products made by forced labour.
2- Developing a novel multi-level, multi-stakeholder approach to connect downstream and upstream supply chains, investigating the impact of consumer behaviour and attitudes on supply chain decisions about anti-slavery practices.
3- Creating innovative machine learning models to explain and predict consumer buying behaviour related to modern slavery, contributing to proactive actions by upstream supply chains.
